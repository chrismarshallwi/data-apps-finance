## Editing Data: Filter, Validate, and Save

This guide explains how to use the demo application to filter data, validate your changes, and save the results.

### 1. Filtering Data

1. Navigate to the **Data Table** section.
2. Use the filter controls above each column to narrow down the dataset.
    - Example: Enter a value in the "Status" filter to show only matching rows.
3. The table updates automatically as you apply filters.

### 2. Validating Data

1. After filtering, select the rows you wish to edit.
2. Make your changes directly in the editable fields.
3. Click the **Validate** button.
    - The application checks for missing or invalid values.
    - Any errors will be highlighted for correction.

### 3. Saving Results

1. Once validation passes, click the **Save** button.
2. A confirmation message will appear.
3. Your changes are now stored and reflected in the dataset.
